**WRF-SMN High-Resolution weather forecast over Argentina**
====

Beginning in April 2022, the National Meteorological Service of Argentina (`SMN-Arg <https://www.smn.gob.ar/>`_) has started sharing data from its weather forecast carried out over southern south America with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The result of a new data policy within the SMN-Arg and the support of Amazon Web Services (AWS) through its Open Data Sponsorship Program, this initiative allows a variety of users to take advantage of a set of weather forecast variables. 

In this site users will find general information about the model, instructions regarding data format and access, along with examples and tutorials to facilitate data use. The official AWS portal can be found in (`https://registry.opendata.aws/smn-ar-wrf-dataset/ <https://registry.opendata.aws/smn-ar-wrf-dataset/>`_).

For any question regarding content of this site, feedback or suggestions, please contact us at odp-aws@smn.gov.ar.
